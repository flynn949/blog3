# About me

I received my PhD in biochemistry from the School of Chemistry at the University of Wollongong, Australia, where I worked with [Nick Dixon](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display/nick_dixon) and [Moeava Tehei](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display/moeava_tehei), using X-ray and neutron scattering to study protein structure and dynamics. Following this, I became a postdoc in the field of single-molecule biophysics in the lab of [Antoine van Oijen](https://smah.uow.edu.au/chem/contacts/UOW187214.html), first in the Netherlands, and later back in Wollongong when the lab migrated there. 

After facing the problem of having to process tens of thousands of trajectories of motion of DNA polymerases, I developed a particular interest in data analysis. This eventually led to my current job as Education Data Analyst in the Learning Analytics unit at UOW. In this role, I analyse student learning data to answer questions about course design and the student experience. Recently, I developed a model to predict students' academic performance. Currently, I am interested in learning about probablistic programming, and will write some posts on this topic and other areas of statistics that I am learning about.
