# About me

I have a background in biochemistry and single molecule biophysics, but I recently traded in my pipettes for a keyboard, and am now working in the field of learning analytics. In this blog, I will share R notebooks in which I go through example problems from biology, education and anything else that could be interesting. One of my goals is to blog as I learn about new topics in statistics and data analysis, so please be warned that I am not always writing from a position of expertise, and if you spot any mistakes please let me know.
