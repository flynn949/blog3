      <description>I recently attended a whole-day workshop on multilevel modelling organised by NIASRA and taught by Professor Mark Tranmer, who is an expert in the field from the University of Glasgow.
Multilevel logistic regressionOne part of the workshop that I realised I didnâ€™t have any familiarity with was the idea of how variance works in logistic regression, and in particular in a multilevel logistic regression.
Here is one way of looking at logistic regression, in a formulation that reflects how a glm works:</description>

      <description>This one is just a snippet. I was reading through the Stan manual (version 2.17.0), and it has some nice examples of Stan models in chapter III, however, only the Stan model code is given for these. I decided to make a data simulation to try one out, specifically, the model in section 9.9: Hierarchical Logistic Regression.
The Stan code from the manual looks like this (after substituting the suggested improvements on pages 140-141).</description>
