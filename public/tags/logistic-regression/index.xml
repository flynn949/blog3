      <description>This one is just a snippet. I was reading through the Stan manual (version 2.17.0), and it has some nice examples of Stan models in chapter III, however, only the Stan model code is given for these. I decided to make a data simulation to try one out, specifically, the model in section 9.9: Hierarchical Logistic Regression.
The Stan code from the manual looks like this (after substituting the suggested improvements on pages 140-141).</description>
