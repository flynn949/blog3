      <description>In this post, I simulate an example experiment in which there is a non-linear relationship with underlying parameters that vary by group membership, before fitting the data using Bayesian regression in Stan. In this example, inspired by a real-world problem (with details changed to protect future Nobel prize winners, so try not to read too much into it), several mutant strains of a species of bacteria have been exposed to a range of concentrations of Chemical X.</description>
