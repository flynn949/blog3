      <description>The ProblemIn this example, inspired by a real-world problem, several mutant strains of a species of bacteria have been exposed to a range of concentrations of Chemical X. Individual bacteria are exposed, and their response is to either turn green (success) or not. Intriguingly, if we measure a lot of trials over a range of concentrations for a single strain (mutant A, below), we see a bell curve-shaped rise and fall in successes as a function of concentration.</description>
