      <description>In this post, I will run through a simple simulation using only base R, and demonstrate a way to do power analysis by using this simulation. Say we have a cohort of 500 first-year students commencing their second session of study. We decide to offer a special tutoring service to some of the students who did not go well in their first session. To do this, we arrange students in ascending order of their averaged first session final marks, and go down the list calling students and offering tutoring services until 50 students have taken up the offer.</description>
